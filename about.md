I enjoy writing about things I learn, speaking about stuff Iâ€™ve experienced, and collecting experiences in general. I also enjoy using side projects to learn new things, to stay fresh, and to collect said experiences. I love writing code because I love building things.

Now that you know so much about me, you should say hi!
