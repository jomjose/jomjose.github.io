Twenty Minutes
================

### We race against the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. This little web app teaches you to work with time, instead of struggling against it. This web app is created with four important points in mind: work with time - not against it, eliminate burnout, manage distractions, create a better work / life balance

- Desktop, Mobile & Web App capable
- Incredible performance and speed of use
- Pure JavaScript: no jQuery or Countdown plugin needed
- Progress bar shows you the percentage completed
- Dynamic favicon and Document title shows the status of the timer
- Local Storage stored as a single unified JSON parameter
- Page loads faster thanks to a single server request
- Timer based on Date and not on unreliable JS timers (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6347336/217180">better accuracy</a>)
- Responsive Design
- Persistent timer (you can close the window and it will continue counting)
- The dynamic favicon uses Tom Moor's <a href="https://github.com/tommoor/tinycon">Tinycon plugin</a>
- Speed improvements on touch devices thanks to The Financial Times's <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick">FastClick</a>
